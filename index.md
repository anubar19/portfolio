Robots built in collaboration with my team for competitive robotics. Each machine features custom-designed mechanisms for tasks such as lifting, intaking, and precise control, powered by integrated motors, sensors, and programmed systems. Built for performance under competition rules, these robots balance durability, speed, and adaptability on the field.

# Speakers

<img src="Files/speaker3.png" width="600" height="500">

Hand-assembled speakers built from quality components and enclosures. I focused on careful construction, wiring, and finishing to achieve reliable performance and a clean look. While based on established designs, the build process gave me hands-on experience with audio hardware and an appreciation for how craftsmanship impacts sound.

A prototype water-purification tablet made using cactus mucilage, designed as a low-cost, accessible solution for removing impurities from water. The project focused on developing a natural, sustainable method for improving water quality, combining simple preparation with effective filtration.

## Rubberband-powered Plane
<img src="Files/plane.png" width="600" height="300">

A lightweight flying model powered by elastic energy: this plane uses a rubber band-driven propeller, wing and tail structures, and a stub assembly to translate stored energy into flight. Built from simple materials, its design emphasizes balance, aerodynamic form, and structural stability so that the model flies reliably and smoothly.

## Automata

<img src="Files/blossom_cad.png" width="400" height="200">

A hand-cranked mechanical automaton built from wood and 3D-printed components. Using a crank and cam system, it generates smooth, repeating motion in a compact frame.
